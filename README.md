Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom business using interactive Power BI dashboards.  
The goal is to identify patterns, risk factors, and customer segments that are more likely to churn, helping businesses take data-driven retention actions.

This dashboard transforms raw customer data into meaningful business insights through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
